# Learning_Python
In this repository is my journey through Python's challenges and how I'm learning it


Hi my name is Matheus and I like technology and science. In this repository I can show you my studies in Python. I have studied Python for aproximately one year and I had had the chance to start my Big Data course at FATEC ipiranga where I intend to improve my programming skills as well as my techniques in order to apply Python techniques to solve institutional problems.
